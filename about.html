                <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p>DreamInk was born from the belief that creativity flourishes when different forms of expression come together. We understand that stories and sketches are often inseparable - a character's appearance inspires their journey, a landscape shapes the mood of a scene.</p>
                <p>Our platform provides a seamless space where writers and artists can explore their imagination without boundaries, where a single thought can evolve into both narrative and visual art.</p>

                <h3>Our Inspiration</h3>
                <p>Many of history's greatest creators were both writers and visual artists - Leonardo da Vinci, William Blake, and Maurice Sendak, to name a few. They understood that stories and images are natural companions.</p>
                <p>DreamInk aims to provide the digital equivalent of an artist's sketchbook where thoughts flow freely between written words and visual expressions.</p>
